# multi-user-blog
A simple multi-user blog made as I learn about the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).

Project specifications from Udacity's [backend](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-backend--ud171) course, and I've implemented some other features that occured to me. Share Bootstrap's free [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template was built upon to make a pretty front-end. I think the MIT license requires that derivative/modified works also displays the license, so I've included it.
